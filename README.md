This is a project for COMP 371 Computer Graphics. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of anti-aliasing in OpenGL as well as showcasing it. The project will consist of a scene with multiple objects rendered to a display. The objects will be rendered with different anti-aliasing techniques enabled and disabled to show the difference in quality.

In order to run the project with different triangle's resolution. We need to cd and open the terminal in the build folder with the antialiasing.exe. Then run the exe with two integers arguments, specifying the width and the height of the triangle respectively.

For example: antialiasing.exe 100 100
